        <p id="tribute-info"> Here is a tribute to two people who have been married over 50 years. 
          They met as children: their fathers were both truck drivers. The families kept in contact through the years
           but ended up in different towns. After Richard had lost his mother he was in town on leave from the Air Force, 
           when Zella and her mom was going to inform the long time friends that her father had passed. 
        <br> The young couple began dating and later Richard proposed using a ring that he had gotten for a steal. 
        They were married in April of 1968. Later, he left the military they had two children a girl and a boy.  
        <br>Then in 1984 Richard was injured on the job. Zella began working multiple jobs to
         try and provide for their family. She drove a school bus during the day and during breaks would do what ever was
         available to put food on the table. The stress became too much and she began to have seizures and was forced into 
         medical retirement.
        <br> After multiple surgeries for Richard's injury and staring at a bank foreclosure; they sold the family home 
        and moved to Florida in 1990. They made many new friends and found a loving
